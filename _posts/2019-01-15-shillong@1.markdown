Shillong is a small city and the best way to experience it is on foot. Walking around the city, exploring its food and culture, talking to the locals could be life time memories for you. Few must  visit places are at a distance and can be reached either by taxis or city bus.


Let me start from the very beginning of our day!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We took a flight from Delhi to Kolkata, and from Kolkata to Shillong. But this was our biggest mistake, as the duration from Kolkata to Shillong is one and a half hours but we flew for almost three hours, as the visibility at  Shillong airport (Barapani Airport) was not that good. We were tensed whether we would land in Shillong or our flight would get diverted to Guwahati . But it was our luck that we landed in Shillong, after delay of almost 3 hours. From there we took a taxi  for our Hotel Which was Located in Police Bazar. On our way we took a small halt at Umiam Lake, this lake is popular for its scenic beauty. After such a tiring and exhausting travel day we just rested in the Hotel.
Due to the delay of flight we lost our 1st day in travelling only and couldn't  explore the nearby places in Shillong, but we were all confident that we will make use of our 2nd day to the fullest.
