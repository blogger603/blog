Shillong, one of the famous and beautiful places in India, is a must visit  for every individual in the world. It is located in the east of India. Encircled by pine trees and clouds waiting to burst into a downpour, the soothing climate here makes it suitable for a visit in all the seasons. The crystal clear lake and the high mountains peak all around make Shillong a tremendous beauty.

                                                                                          

Shillong is famous for its rains, there is a constant weather throughout the year. This is the thing that tourists like the most as the weather here is always pleasant and cool.
People who live in the hot and humid would definitely love to come here.



These are some images from the topmost 
point of Shillong.

Tucked away in East Khasi Hills, this city offered a much needed respite from continuous travelling , through gruelling road conditions in much of the rest of north- east.
