On this day we decided to visit Cherrapunji, which has held the record of the highest rainfall on earth a number of times. As we were four people so we decided to higher a separate taxi. Our first stop on that day was Shillong peak, it was such a beautiful place, you can view whole of Shillong city covered with little patches of cloud.


Then we proceeded towards Elephants Falls (which is very near to the Shillong Peak). The unique fall gushes out water in three tiers, the bottom one being the great. There are about 150 steps that take you down til the bottom of the fall.

The drive till Cherrapunji is about an hour and half long and the journey was indeed breathtakThe rains, clouds, chilly wind, waterfalls and the greenery together makes a journey towards paradise.
The town has over a dozen stunning waterfalls and living-root bridges

Visiting Mawsmai Caves was also a great experience, It is looked after by the tourism department and can provide good fun to beginners interested in cave exploration.


After this we headed back to Shillong there we visited the St. Joseph's Catholic Church. It has been constructed with such a beauty that you can't resist coming here again. At night we had a wonderful dinner at the Shillong famous " City Hut Dhaba". The atmosphere created there was just wonderful and the food was also just yum!!!!!
