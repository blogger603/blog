Third day we planned to visit Mawlynnong, cleanest village in Asia as recorded by "Discover India Magazine". It is situated around 90km from the Shillong city(in the Shillong - Dawki road). The cleanliness and management of the village is still touted to be a model of development for other villages. You won't find a single piece of plastic trash on the road and the entire village is dotted with bamboo garbage cans.

A visit to the living root bridge, near the river Riwai, made entirely of the living tree roots is a must see when in that place. The village also presents a captivating view of a natural balancing rock, a strange natural phenomenon of rocks balancing on other rocks. Another remarkable construction here is the Sky view, a 85 feet high tower, made out of bamboo. From here there is a stunning view of the village and the neighbouring country Bangladesh. The warm Hospitality of the villagers there will really make one feel happy.

After leaving Mawlynnong we headed towards Dawki(Where the Indo - Bangladesh border was situated). The journey to Dawki was filled with nature, and the cool breeze was rejuvenating. The roads were through green tracks of forests and not too far, the plains of Bangladesh were visible. In our way we also had a glimpse of many waterfalls which were not visited by too many tourists but were really beautiful!!!!!
The Umngot River was the main attraction in Dawki to watch for. The river is forded by a suspension bridge that connects India to Bangladesh and facilitates trade between the nations. Seeing the boat rushing above the water was just tremendous. The best time to visit this place is when there is no rain, as that time the water will be still and you can watch deep inside the water.

While returning back we ended our trip by visiting Ward's lake. It is the famous artificial lake set in the middle of Shillong city. It is a lake in middle of a well-maintained botanical garden offering mesmerising view of colourful flowers and ducks. The surrounding garden with cobble-stoned paths also has fountains with enhance the beauty of the lake.
As it was our last day in Shillong so we decided to go to the police bazar at night  so that we could buy some souvenirs for ourselves.

        
        SOME THINGS TO BE KEEP IN MIND


        1. its is pitch dark at around 5p.m:

        2. Always start early your day, as it starts getting fog at about 8a.m.

        3. Always carry a umbrella with you, here rain is unpredictable.

     So that's it for my travel story from Shillong. Cannot wait to be there again
